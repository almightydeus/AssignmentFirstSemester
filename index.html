      <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Justin Omeke: A Journey in Computer Science</strong><br />
        My name is John Chukwuemeka Omeke, and I was a student of Computer
        Science at Enugu State Polytechnic. Since my early childhood, I’ve been
        fascinated by technology and how it can solve complex problems, which
        led me to choose a path in software development. This biography outlines
        my journey from an early fascination with coding to my current studies
        and aspirations in the field of Cloud Engineering. <br /><br />
        <strong>Early Life and Interest in Technology</strong><br />
        Born and raised in a Enugu town, I was first introduced to computers at
        the age of 14, after my JSS 3 examination. My mum bought my first
        laptop, and I was immediately captivated. What began as hours spent
        playing video games e.g GTA etc soon evolved into a deeper interest in
        understanding how the tech space works. I spent countless hours
        exploring how it worked, from basic programming to understanding
        hardware components. <br /><br />
        <strong>Academic Journey</strong><br />
        At Enugu State Polytechnic, I’ve had the opportunity to deepen my
        knowledge in various areas of Computer Science theoritically including
        software development, algorithms, programming languages and artificial
        intelligence but never had a practical experience of all mentioned. To
        be honest, Nigeria education is messed up, will never advice anyone to
        attend when it comes to practical aspect. <br /><br />
        <strong>Personal Interests and Extracurricular Activities</strong><br />
        Outside the classroom, I am an active member of the Polytechnic Coding
        Club, where I’ve participated in minor hackathons and coding
        competitions. I also enjoy mentoring younger students who are just
        beginning their journey in Computer Science but I suck at teaching. In
        my spare time, I like to explore new programming languages, contribute
        to open-source projects, and stay updated with the latest trends in
        technology and that's why I enrolled for the Cloud Engineering course at
        AltSchool to upscale my skill and make much bigger money or bag like we
        do call it in the street. <br /><br />
        <strong>Future Aspirations</strong><br />
        I’m excited to continue learning and growing in the field of Computer
        Science at AltSchool. My goal is to become a cloud engineer at a leading
        web3 tech company where I can contribute to developing innovative
        solutions that make a positive impact on society and free everyone from
        government restrictions. <br /><br />
        <strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
        Reflecting on my journey so far, I’m proud of the progress I’ve made and
        excited about the road ahead. My passion for computer science continues
        to grow as I explore new technologies and tackle complex problems. I
        look forward to contributing to the tech industry and making a
        meaningful difference in the world through innovation and creativity.
