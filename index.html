    <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
    <p>
      <h3>JUSTIN OMEKE: A Journey in Computer Science</h3>
      <p>My name is John Chukwuemeka Omeke, and I was a student of Computer
      Science at Enugu State Polytechnic. Since my early childhood, I’ve been
      fascinated by technology and how it can solve complex problems, which
      led me to choose a path in software development. This biography outlines
      my journey from an early fascination with coding to my current studies
      and aspirations in the field of Cloud Engineering.</p>
      <h3>Early Life and Interest in Technology</h3>
      <p>Born and raised in a Enugu town, I was first introduced to computers at
      the age of 14, after my JSS 3 examination. My mum bought my first
      laptop, and I was immediately captivated. What began as hours spent
      playing video games e.g GTA etc soon evolved into a deeper interest in
      understanding how the tech space works. I spent countless hours
      exploring how it worked, from basic programming to understanding
      hardware components.</p>
      <h3>Academic Journey</h3>
      <p>At Enugu State Polytechnic, I’ve had the opportunity to deepen my
      knowledge in various areas of Computer Science theoritically including
      software development, algorithms, programming languages and artificial
      intelligence but never had a practical experience of all mentioned. To
      be honest, Nigeria education is messed up, will never advice anyone to
      attend when it comes to practical aspect.</p>
      <h3>Personal Interests and Extracurricular Activities</h3>
      <p>Outside the classroom, I am an active member of the Polytechnic Coding
      Club, where I’ve participated in minor hackathons and coding
      competitions. I also enjoy mentoring younger students who are just
      beginning their journey in Computer Science but I suck at teaching. In
      my spare time, I like to explore new programming languages, contribute
      to open-source projects, and stay updated with the latest trends in
      technology and that's why I enrolled for the Cloud Engineering course at
      AltSchool to upscale my skill and make much bigger money or bag like we
      do call it in the street.</p>
      <h3>Future Aspirations</h3>
      <p>I’m excited to continue learning and growing in the field of Computer
      Science at AltSchool. My goal is to become a cloud engineer at a leading
      web3 tech company where I can contribute to developing innovative
      solutions that make a positive impact on society and free everyone from
      government restrictions.</p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Reflecting on my journey so far, I’m proud of the progress I’ve made and
      excited about the road ahead. My passion for computer science continues
      to grow as I explore new technologies and tackle complex problems. I
      look forward to contributing to the tech industry and making a
      meaningful difference in the world through innovation and creativity.</p>
